我不知道那是什么意思。
I don't know what that means.

128
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,728
就像你之前的乌龟大师一样。

你将监督山谷，传递智慧，激发希望。

这是乌龟大师给你的。

137
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,667
你真的认为是为了开一家餐馆吗?

或者摆姿势拍照?

139
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,670
他说得不是很具体。
He wasn't super specific.

00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,806
不。乌龟不是给我的。
No. Oogway did not give it to me.

144
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,268
成为下一个乌龟不是我的命运，我已经接受了
Being the next Oogway is not my destiny,which I have accepted

145
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,561
我也很平静。

00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,400
这是我的荣幸。
This is an honor.

149
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,529
乌龟选择你作为他的继承人，现在你必须选择你的。
Oogway chose you as his successor,and now you must choose yours.

150
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,324
师父，我终于找到了我的拿手好戏，
Master Shifu,I finally found something I'm good at,

151
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,117
现在你想把它从我身边夺走?
and now you want tojust take it away from me?

152
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,286
没人能拿走任何东西，阿宝。
No one is taking anything away, Po.

153
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,830
你是谁将永远是你成为的一部分。
Who you are will always bea part of what you become.

154
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,583
是啊，但"skadoosh"在哪里?你懂我的意思吗?
Yeah, but where's the "skadoosh"?You know what I mean?

155
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,335
“shasha-booie”?
The "shasha-booie"?

156
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,836
我不想显得忘恩负义，
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

157
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,506
但我不知道如何传递智慧或激发希望。
but I don't know anythingabout passing on wisdom or inspiring hope.

158
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,549
我只知道两件事。
All I know are two things.

159
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,886
踢屁股，记名字。
Kicking butt and taking names.

160
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,972
如果我完全诚实的话，我甚至不擅长取别人的名字。
And if I'm being completely honest,I'm not even that good at the name-taking.

161
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,140
比如，那个喷火的鳄鱼是谁?
Like, who wasthat fire-breathing crocodile?

162
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,643
我想说史蒂夫…

你被选中是为了给山谷带来和平，
You were chosento bring peace to the Valley,

164

还有其他的方法可以带来和平，而不是简单的打屁股。
and there are other ways to bring peacethan simply kicking butt.

165
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,485
嗯,当然。但都不是有趣的。
Well, sure. But not any fun ones.

166
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,821
请。我只知道做神龙武士。
Please. Being the Dragon Warrioris all I know.

167
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,990
-这就是我。——了。
-It's who I am.-Not anymore.

168
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,159
和平谷需要一位精神领袖，
The Valley of Peace needsa Spiritual Leader,

169

这对我找到答案有什么帮助?

别问我。问问宇宙吧。

做坑吧，阿宝。成为坑。

[exclaims]

296
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:21,839
哇!
Whoa!

297
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,633
(的)
[grunting]

298
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,680
哇!
Whoa!

299
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,099
哇!
Whoa!

300
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,687
告诉丫。
Told ya.

301
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,815
你说对了，强大的饺子战士。
You got me,oh-great-and-powerful Dumpling Warrior.

302
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,775
这就是《神龙大侠》——[尖叫]
That's Dragon Warrior-- [yelps]

303
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,319
放开我。
Let go of me.

304
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:45,654
就告诉我一件事。
Just tell me one thing.

305
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,073
像你这样的人是怎么成为神龙大侠的?
How did someone like youbecome the Dragon Warrior?

306
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,367
这是你在这两年里要解决的一个谜
That's a mystery for you to solveduring your two-year stay

307
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,785
在和平谷监狱
at the Valley of Peace prison.

308
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,746
和平谷监狱?[嘲笑]听起来像日托。
Valley of Peace prison? [scoffs]Sounds like a day care.

309
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,498
这是周末的日托所。
It is a day care on the weekends.

310
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,709
但它也是一座监狱。
But it's also a prison.

311
00:15:58,792 --> 00:15:59,918
[村民]他在那儿!
[villager] There he is!

312
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:00,961
神龙大侠!
Dragon Warrior!

313
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,963
-[工头]大龙回来了。-大龙回来了?
-[ram foreman] Tai Lung is back.-Tai Lung has returned?

314
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,133
他要了我们所有的铁，然后毁了我们的采石场。
He demanded all of our iron,then destroyed our quarry.

315
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,719
-他应该在灵界。-他回来了。
-He's supposed to be in the Spirit Realm.-Well, he's back.

316
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,597
他说他不会罢手，直到和平谷陷落
He said that he's not gonna stopuntil the Valley of Peace falls

317
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,932
神龙大侠在他面前鞠躬。
and the Dragon Warriorbows before him.

318
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,101
他回来了。-求你了，你得做点什么。
-He's back.-Please, you've got to do something.

319
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,147
看来我不是这里唯一一个有谜团要解开的人。
Looks like I'm not the only onearound here with a mystery to solve.

320
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,149
你知道他们怎么说…
Well, you know what they say…

321
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:26,987
每一步都留下足迹，不管多小。
every step leaves a footprint,no matter how small.

322
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:51,178
每一步都留下一个脚印，不管它有多小。
[Po] Every step leaves a footprint,no matter how small.

323
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,602
狐狸，你真聪明。你知道的。
Very clever, fox. You know something.

324
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,771
也许我有，也许我没有。
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

325
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,148
好吧，我知道。我真的，真的。
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

326
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,816
-告诉我。-我为什么要?
-Tell me.-And why should I?

327
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,026
我是说，这对我有什么好处?
I mean, what's in it for me?

328
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,111
知道自己做了正确的事，内心的平静。
The peace of mindknowing you did the right thing.

329
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,656
你是可爱的。有人告诉过你吗?
You're adorable.Has anyone ever told you that?

330
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,449
我指的不是那种让人抱抱的感觉。
And I don't mean just in, like,the cuddly sense.

331
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,742
我没有时间玩游戏。
I don't have time for games.

332
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,911
大龙在和平谷中四处游荡。
Tai Lung is running loosein the Valley of Peace.

333
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:20,082
也许吧。或者她想让你以为是大龙。
Maybe. Or maybe she wants you to thinkit was Tai Lung.

334
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,333
等待。她吗?
Wait. She?

335
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,626
我的!
Mine!

336
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,672
伪装皇后，可以变成任何形式，
The Empress of Disguise,capable of taking any form,

337
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:27,964
<i>模仿任何形状。</i>
<i>mimicking any shape.</i>

338
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,091
<i>骗术大师。</i>
<i>The master of deception.</i>

339
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,468
<i>蜥蜴长着发光的蓝绿色眼睛。</i>
<i>The lizard of lieswith the glowing teal eyes.</i>

340
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:32,678
<i>我在说…</i>
<i>I'm talking 'bout…</i>

341
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,430
变色龙。
The Chameleon.

342
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:36,515
(警卫喘气)
[guards gasp]

343
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,685
这是私人谈话。
This is kind of a private conversation.

344
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,894
(喇叭)
[honking]

345
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,437
谁是变色龙?
Who's The Chameleon?

346
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,815
只有最强大的变形女巫。
Only the most powerfulshape-shifting sorceress.

347
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,276
于是她变成了大龙。
So she shape-shifted into Tai Lung.

348
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,945
但她对我和平谷有什么不满呢?
But what does she have against meand the Valley of Peace?

349
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,114
这些都是很好的问题。你应该问问她。
These are good questions.You should ask her.

350
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:56,034
你是对的。我怎么找到这个"变色龙"
You're right.How do I find this "The Chameleon"?

351
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,703
她不是那种可以找到的人。
She isn't someone who can be found.

352
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,497
至少没有知情人在场。
At least not without someone in the know.

353
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,375
我怎样才能找到“知情人”呢?
And how do I find someone "in the know"?

354
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,461
(叹息)哦!是我。很明显是我。
[sighs] Oh! It's me.It's obviously-- It's me.

355
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:07,754
我知道内情。
I'm in the know.

356
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,299
算了吧。我自己去找她。
Forget it. I'll find her on my own.

357
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:11,925
祝你好运。
Good luck.

358
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,095
毕竟，找到一个长得像任何人的人有多难，
After all, how hard can it beto find someone who can look like anyone,

359
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:16,388
融入任何地方?
blend in anywhere?

360
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,352
很好。你带我去找变色龙
Fine. You lead me to The Chameleon,

361
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,730
我看看能不能帮你减刑
and I'll see what I can doabout reducing your sentence.

362
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,023
交易。
Deal.

363
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,233
——(师傅)阿宝!——(世行))
-[Shifu] Po!-[yelps]

364
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,526
你以为你在干什么?
What do you think you're doing?

365
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,988
(结巴)有个会变形的女巫在外面游荡
[stammers] There's this shape-shiftingsorceress on the loose and--

366
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,073
那是盖世五侠的工作。
That's a job for the Furious Five.

367
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,118
他们不在这里，需要有人来保护和平谷。
Well, they're not here, and someoneneeds to protect the Valley of Peace.

368
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:39,995
听着，我知道改变很难
Look, I know that change is difficult

369
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,539
你喜欢当神龙大侠
and that you enjoybeing the Dragon Warrior,

370
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,000
但你的工作是找继任者。
but your job is finding a successor.

371
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,462
神龙大侠和我有个约定。管好你自己的事，松鼠。
The Dragon Warrior and I have a deal.Mind your own business, squirrel.

372
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,172
师父不是松鼠。
Master Shifu is not a squirrel.

373
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,423
我是一只小熊猫。
I'm a red panda.

374
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,551
你知道吗?我喜欢你这样。
You know what? I love that for you.

375
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,178
阿宝，这由你决定。
Po, this is your decision.

376
00:18:56,261 --> 00:19:00,641
但我想你知道乌龟大师想让你做什么选择。
But I think you know what choiceMaster Oogway would want you to make.

377
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,397
-谢谢你的免费住宿。-[师父]你在干什么?
-Thanks for the free stay.-[Shifu] What are you doing?

378
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,815
-对日托来说有点潮湿-等等!
-Little dank for a day care.-Wait!

379
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,359
-对监狱来说还不错。-她要去哪里?
-Not bad for a jail.-Where is she going?

380
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,443
你不能走。
You can't leave.

381
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,696
别担心，我会在你发现她离开之前把她找回来的。
Don't worry, I'll have her backbefore you even know she was gone.

382
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,908
你应该传递智慧和鼓舞希望!
You are supposed to bepassing along wisdom and inspiring hope!

383
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,661
就把它想象成最后一次神龙大侠冒险吧。
Just think of it asone last Dragon Warrior adventure.

384
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,038
我很快就回来。告诉我爸爸我爱他们。
I'll be back soon.Tell my dads I love 'em.

385
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,374
-我听不见了!再见!——(只)
-I can't hear you anymore! Bye!-[honks]

386
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:27,501
(叹息)
[groans]

387
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:31,421
是啊!再次成为一只自由的狐狸真是太好了。
Yeah! It sure is goodto be a free fox again.

388
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,090
那是一个很好的挠背器。
That's a good back scratcher.

389
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,424
-Yoink ! -嘿!
-Yoink!-Hey!

390
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,677
这真的能打开通往灵界的大门吗?
So, does this really unlock the doorto the Spirit Realm?

391
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,303
事情不是这样的。
It doesn't work like that.

392
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:41,098
为了获得它的力量，它必须被给予。
It has to be givenin order to gain its powers.

393
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,059
明白了。为了获得。所以，能给我吗?
Gotcha. Given to gain.So, can I have it?

394
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,811
不!你把我当什么人了?
No! What do you take me for?

395
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:46,895
一个容易的目标。
An easy mark.

396
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:47,980
什么是容易的标记?
What's an easy mark?

397
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,648
一个很容易被偷的人
Someone who's easy to steal from,

398
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,859
通常是因为他们很慷慨，而且太容易相信别人。
usually because they're generousand too trusting.

399
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,027
如你。-哦，谢谢。
-Like you.-Aw, thank you.

400
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:00,742
我听说变色龙是一种怪兽，有上千种捕食者的胃口，
I heard The Chameleon is a monsterwith an appetite of a thousand predators,

401
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:02,870
她最喜欢的食物是熊猫。
and her favorite food is panda.

402
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:06,665
他们说这个变色龙有神奇的力量。
They say this Chameleon characterhas magical powers.

403
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:10,419
如果你叫她的名字三次，她就会在夜里把你带走!
If you say her name three times,she'll take you away in the night!

404
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,962
(小兔子哭)
[bunnies crying]

405
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:15,883
变色龙可以变形成任何人的样子，甚至是你。
The Chameleon can shape-shiftto look like anyone, even you.

406
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,384
或者你。
Or you.

407
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,973
李先生!李先生!这是真的吗?
Mr. Li! Mr. Li! Is it true?

408
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,767
[小兔]阿宝要拿下一个邪恶的女巫?
[bunny] Po's going totake down an evil sorceress?

409
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,728
变色龙?
The-- The Chameleon?

410
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:31,064
(笑)好吧，神龙大侠的工作永无止境。
[chuckles] Well, a Dragon Warrior's workis never done.

411
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:34,318
李，我在想阿宝和一个重罪犯合作
Li, I'm thinking Po teaming upwith a convicted felon

412
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:38,197
干掉一个邪恶的女巫不是个好主意。
to take down an evil sorceresswasn't such a great idea.

413
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,160
放松。阿宝面对过恶魔、半人半神，以及介于两者之间的一切。
Relax. Po has faced demons, demigods,and everything else in between.

414
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,369
他总是获胜。
He's always come out on top.

415
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,580
你是对的。你是对的。
You're right. You're right.

416
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,457
但如果你错了呢?
But what if you're wrong?

417
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,209
冷静点，平。
Calm down, Ping.

418
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,212
一个邪恶的女巫能有多坏?
How bad can one evil sorceress be?

419
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,633
她是谁，凭什么召唤我们?
[bear crime boss] Who is she to summon us?

420
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:58,884
[鳄鱼犯罪老板]经典的权力举动。
[crocodile crime boss] Classic power move.

421
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:02,262
我们是瞻博城最著名的犯罪家族的首领。
We're the heads of Juniper City'smost prominent crime families.

422
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:05,891
她只是个眼有虫眼，渴望权力的爬虫类侏儒。
And she's just some bug-eyed,power-hungry reptilian runt.

423
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,601
你漏掉了邪恶女巫的部分。
You left out the evil sorceress part.

424
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,478
我们曾经统治过这座城市。
We used to run this city.

425
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:12,064
现在我们把骗来的钱分给她一半。
Now we pay her half the money we swindle.

426
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,650
就像一个罪犯再也不能诚实地生活了。
It's like a criminal can'tmake an honest living anymore.

427
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,151
是啊，但我们能怎么办呢?
Yeah, but what could we do?

428
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,363
我们一起就能拿下她。
Together, we can take her down.

429
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:22,282
-[喘气]-你疯了吗?她是个变形人。
-[all gasp]-Are you nuts? She's a shape-shifter.

430
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:26,286
她可能就在这张桌子旁，而我们却浑然不知。
She could be at this very table,and we'd have no idea.

431
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,165
据我们所知，你就是变色龙。
For all we know,you're The Chameleon.

432
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:32,084
或者你是变色龙。
Or you're The Chameleon.

433
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,836
-或者…-哦，不。
-Or maybe…-Oh, no.

434
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,212
-也许…-别说了
-Maybe…-Don't say it.

435
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:37,506
我是变色龙。
[as The Chameleon] …I'm The Chameleon.

436
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:38,715
我说了别说出来。
I said don't say it.

437
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,141
我们说话显然不合时宜。
We obviously spoke out of turn.

438
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:49,226
对不起,变色龙。
Sorry, Chameleon.

439
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,103
不,不。不要道歉。
No, no. Don't apologize.

440
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:55,607
你和你的家族靠掠夺弱者发家致富，
You and your families prosperedby preying upon the weak,

441
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:59,361
所以当你被挤压的时候感觉不太好。
so it doesn't feel goodwhen you're the one being squeezed.

442
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,030
尤其是当他在挤压的时候
Especially when the onedoing the squeezing

443
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:05,534
只是一个“眼睛有毛病，渴望权力”的人……
is just a "bug-eyed, power-hungry"…

444
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,119
剩下的是什么?
What was the rest?

445
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:09,037
爬虫类的矮子。
Reptilian runt.

446
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:13,208
这个“爬虫小人”想要更多。
Well, this "reptilian runt" wants more.

447
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:15,252
你已经占领了这座城市。
You already have the city.

448
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,212
你还想要什么?
What else could you possibly want?

449
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:21,300
我有个特别的主意。我就快实现了。
I have something special in mind.I'm very close to achieving it.

450
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:24,094
就像血月一样近。
As close as the blood moon.

451
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,762
但离血月还有两晚。
But the blood moonis two nights away.

452
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:28,390
这么少的时间，这么多的开销。
So little time, so many expenses.

453
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:33,812
这就是为什么我要把这个月的贡金提高到60%。
Which is why I'll need to increasethis month's tribute to 60%.

454
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:34,938
不。
No.

455
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,320
那是什么声音?
What was that now?

456
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:44,406
我无意冒犯。
I mean no disrespect.

457
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:47,701
别担心。
Don't worry.

458
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:53,665
我原谅你的无礼和背后中伤。
I forgive you for the impudenceand the backstabbing.

459
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:59,087
你对我明目张胆的不尊重，我原谅。
And the blatant disrespectyou've shown me, I forgive.

460
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:01,965
但我永远不会忘记。
But I never forget.

461
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,259
你可能会说我有记忆…
You might say I have the memory…

462
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:05,469
哦，别说了。
Oh, don't say it.

463
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,596
一只大象。
…of an elephant.

464
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,100
(叹息)
[groans]

465
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,776
(喇叭)
[trumpets]

466
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:23,362
(所有喘气)
[all gasp]

467
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:26,615
你觉得我把你逼得太紧了?
You thinkI've pushed you too far?

468
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:30,786
那你，我的朋友，根本无法理解
Then you, my friend, can't begin to fathom

469
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:34,623
我能做到什么程度
just how far I can push.

470
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,001
(呻吟,呻吟)
[grunting, groaning]

471
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,419
(哽咽)
[whimpering]

472
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:43,715
黎明前我等你的贡品。
I'll expect your tributes by dawn.

473
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,680
我们要停下来吃午饭吗?
Are we gonna stopfor lunch soon?

474
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,765
正义不会停下来吃午饭。
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

475
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,643
但偶尔也要停下来吃点零食。
But it does take the occasional time-outfor snackage.

476
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,436
要不要分我的杏仁饼干?
Wanna split my almond cookie?

477
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,023
你就打算把你的一半饼干给我就因为你心地善良吗?
You're just gonna give me half of yourcookie out of the goodness of your heart?

478
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,401
-嗯。-有什么隐情?摩擦?欺骗吗?
-Mm-hmm.-What's the catch? The rub? The bamboozle?

479
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:03,360
“bam-what-le”?
The "bam-what-le"?

480
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,404
你知道，羊毛。车。胡说的。
You know, the fleece.The rook. The flimflam.

481
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,989
你到底要不要饼干?
Do you want the cookie or not?

482
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,284
——[的](处理)
-[grunting]-[crunching]

483
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:12,452
我会盯着你的。
I got my eye on you.

484
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,957
离“变色龙”还有多远?
How much farther is itto this "The Chameleon"?

485
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,166
再往前走一点。
Just a little farther.

486
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:33,056
(两个尖叫)
[both screaming]

487
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,602
李!你大半夜的在这里干什么?
Li! What are you doing out herein the middle of the night?

488
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:40,272
我…我…我不想错过血月升起的时候。
Well, I-- I-- I… didn't wanna missthe blood moon rising.

489
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:43,025
哦,呸。你和我一样担心。
Oh, pooh.You are just as worried as I am.

490
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,443
好吧，好吧。
All right, all right.

491
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:47,279
我知道熊猫给人的印象是平静、温柔和冷酷，
I know pandas come across ascalm, gentle and chill,

492
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,615
但是……(笑)……事实是
but… [chuckles] …the truth is

493
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,200
我有点害怕!
I'm kinda freaking out!

494
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,242
我也是。
So am I.

495
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:56,538
面对一个会变形的女巫，阿宝太过冷静、温柔和冷静。
Po is just too calm, gentle and chillto face a shape-shifting sorceress.

496
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:59,416
如果他被抓了怎么办?如果他被折磨了呢?(喘息)
-What if he's captured?-What if he's tortured? [gasps]

497
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,335
我们的孩子!
[both] Our baby!

498
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:03,921
好吧,好吧。
Okay, okay.

499
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:06,173
也许阿宝终于遇到对手了，
Maybe Po has finally met his match,

500
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:10,135
但他仍然有变色龙没有的东西。
but there is still something that he hasthat The Chameleon does not.

501
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,262
什么? -美国。
-What's that?-Us.

502
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:15,182
现在，我们去找我们的儿子吧。
Now, let's go find our son.

503
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,391
我希望阿宝没事。
I hope Po's okay.

504
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:19,436
你知道吗，李，一只聪明的鹅曾经说过，
You know, Li,a wise goose once said,

505
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,481
“担心并不能让汤煮得更快。”
"Worrying doesn't makethe broth boil any faster."

506
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,983
那个白痴是谁?当然是我了。
-[Li] Who was that idiot?-[Mr. Ping] Me, of course.

507
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,527
我是聪明的鹅。
I was the wise goose.

508
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,278
[李]哦，是的。
[Li] Oh, yeah.

509
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,197
(Po)哇。
[Po] Whoa.

510
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,241
那是我见过的最大的村庄。
That's the biggest village I've ever seen.

511
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,034
[狐狸]那不是村庄。
[fox] That's no village.

512
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,994
这就是杜松城。
That's Juniper City.

513
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:37,829
那就是我能找到变色龙的地方，对吧?
That's where I'll findThe Chameleon, huh?

514
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:39,373
坐船就到了。
Just a boat ride away.

515
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,959
我带你去她家的前门。
And I'm gonna lead youright to her front door.

516
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,919
你确定我们能在里面找到船长吗?
Are you sure we'll finda boat captain in there?

517
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,797
只要价格合适，那些杀手会带我们去任何我们想去的地方。
For the right price, those cutthroats willtake us anywhere we want to go.

518
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:50,509
当然，我们也可以选择四指折扣。
Of course, we could always opt forthe four-finger discount.

519
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,802
没有偷窃。
No stealing.

520
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,304
“快乐兔酒馆”。
"The Happy Bunny Tavern".

521
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:56,181
听起来很诱人。
Well, that sounds inviting.

522
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:57,766
(尖叫声,普通员工)
[screams, grunts]

523
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,105
有人丢了一只兔子吗?
Anybody lose a rabbit?

524
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:09,319
(咕哝声,呻吟)
[grunts, groans]

525
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:10,612
搅拌速度!
Stir faster!

526
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:12,948
(哽咽)
[whimpering]

527
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:16,118
欢迎来到快乐兔酒馆。
Welcome to the Happy Bunny Tavern.

528
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,954
我去找辆车送我们。也许你能给我们弄点吃的。
I'll find us a ride.Maybe you can get us some food.

529
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:20,914
别惹麻烦。
And stay out of trouble.

530
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,543
嘿，你们在玩什么?
Hey, what you guys playing?

531
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,295
麻将。
Mah-jongg.

532
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,963
而且风险很高。
And the stakes are high.

533
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,047
我可以玩吗?
Can I play?

534
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:32,467
你肯定不会对初学者太苛刻，因为我才刚刚入门。
Surely you'll go easy on a beginner,'cause I'm very beginning.

535
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:34,136
(赌徒笑)
[gamblers chuckle]

536
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,346
-嘿。你要点什么?
-Hey there.-What can I get you?

537
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,223
乘船去杜松城。
A boat ride to Juniper City.

538
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:39,308
问这个人。
Ask this guy.

539
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:41,018
(呼出)
[exhales]

540
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:43,854
-他是谁?-他是船长。
-Who's he?-He's the captain.

541
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,397
——(硬币叮当声)-谢谢。
-[coin clinks]-Thanks.

[grunts]

543
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:48,525
(叹息)
[sighs]

544
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:51,320
哦，我又赢了。我想这是新手的运气吧。
Oh, I win again.Beginner's luck, I guess.

545
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:53,197
以前没玩过吧?
Never played before, huh?

546
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,199
不好意思，你是在指责我出轨吗?
I'm sorry, are you accusing meof cheating?

547
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,492
我想请经理听电话。
I would like to speakto the manager, please.

548
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:59,494
我是经理。
I am the manager.

549
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:04,208
我可以带你坐船去朱尼珀城，但我不会带任何非法物品。
I'll give you a boat ride to Juniper City,but I won't carry anything illegal.

550
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,584
我不想惹麻烦。
I don't want any trouble.

551
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,544
[轻笑]烦恼离我而去。
[chuckles] Trouble runs from me.

552
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:09,004
那你得花双倍的钱。
[squawks] Then it'll cost you double.

553
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,548
我困惑。我应该说我喜欢麻烦吗?
I'm confused.Should I have said that I like trouble?

554
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:13,383
那样的话，你要花三倍的钱。
In that case, it'll cost you triple.

555
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:16,053
哦。也许我们可以恢复双倍价格?
Oh. Uh, maybe we can go backto the double price?

556
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:20,474
一言为定。
You got a deal.

557
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,435
太好了。我是跟他握手还是跟你握手?
Great.Do I shake his hand or your hand?

558
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:25,854
夫人，您还需要点什么吗?
Can I get anything else for you, ma'am?

559
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:27,314
是的。一切,再次。
Yes. Everything, again.

560
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,358
除了肉汤。它很平淡。
Except for the broth. It was very bland.

561
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:30,943
小激动人心!——(世行))
-Keep stirring!-[yelps]

562
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:35,113
哇!其中一种是我的最爱。
Whoa! One of everything is my go-to order.

563
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:37,157
但你怎么付的钱?
But how did you pay for this?

564
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,117
合法的。依法。光明正大。
Legally. Lawfully. Fair and square.

565
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:40,577
-我为你骄傲-[咕哝]
-I'm proud of you.-[grunts]

569
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:52,673
哦,哇!看看时间。
Oh, wow! Look at the time.

570
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,592
还记得我们要和那家伙一起做的事吗?
Remember we have to do that thingdown by the place with that guy?

571
00:27:55,676 --> 00:28:00,097
你真以为能骗我吃顿饭吗?
Did you actually think you couldgrift a meal out of me?

572
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,141
(咽了一声)这里一定有什么误会。
[gulps] There's gotta be some sortof misunderstanding here.

573
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:07,563
显然，我才是那个被误解的人。
And apparently,I'm the one misunderstanding.

574
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:10,691
请允许我们为我们和你们的餐费买单。
Please allow us to pay for our mealand yours too.

575
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:12,693
我只想吃……
I'm only hungry for…

576
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,152
饺子? -…复仇!
-Dumplings?-…vengeance!

577
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:16,113
好吧，那就来拿吧。
Well, then, come and get it.

578
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,115
不!不，不，不!别过来拿!
No! No, no, no! Don't come and get it!

579
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,158
摧毁他们!-[酒馆主顾咆哮]

[groans] Yeah, I think it'sa little too late for that.

601
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,375
做正确的事永远不会太晚。
It's never too late to do the right thing.

[酒馆顾客尖叫]
[tavern patrons screaming]

614
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,379
谁会在悬崖上设计酒馆?
Who designs a tavern on a cliff?

615
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:40,090
我不应该把所有的饺子都吃了。(世行))
I shouldn't have eatenall those dumplings. [yelps]

-不是我担心，但是…-[鸣笛]
-Not that I'm worried, but…-[honks]

626
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:07,159
万一变色龙知道我们来了怎么办?
…what if The Chameleon knowswe're coming?

627
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:09,369
她可能在任何地方，任何人。
Why, she could be anywhere, anyone.

628
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:12,247
李，你能不能有点骨气?
Li, would you please showa little backbone?

629
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:15,751
抱歉，但勇敢不是我的专长。
I'm sorry, but bravery was neverreally my specialty.

630
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:20,547
(鸣笛)你不需要勇敢。你只需要表现得勇敢一点。
[honks] You don't have to be brave.You just have to act brave.

631
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:22,716
勇敢的行动?明白了。
Act brave? Got it.

632
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,385
——啊!(尖叫)-哦!
-Ah! [screams]-Oh!

633
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,803
哦,李!
Oh, Li!

——(尖叫)零!

抱紧我，平!一切都白费了!
Hold me, Ping! It's all been for nothing!

636
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,519
请,不。
Please, no.

637
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:35,938
我太年轻了!——(砰砰声)
-I'm too young!-[thuds]

638
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:41,235
表现得勇敢怎么样?
How was that for acting brave?

639
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:43,153
(叹气)继续努力。
[sighs] Keep working on it.

640
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:49,409
(甄叹口气)杜松城。
[Zhen sighs] Juniper City.

641
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:51,328
能再次回家真是太好了。
It's going to be greatto be back home again.

642
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,330
你的家人也住在那里吗?
Does your family live there too?

643
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,666
他们会。如果我有个家。
They would. If I had a family.

644
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,836
在大城市里做一个小狐狸并不容易。
It wasn't easy being a little foxin a big city.

645
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,005
<i>所以我必须想尽办法活下去。</i>
<i>So I had to survive any way I could.</i>

646
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:03,048
嘿!
Hey!

停止运行!停止运行!
Stop running! Stop running!

649
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,895
哇，你是个孤儿?我也是。
Whoa, you're an orphan? So am I.

650
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:18,355
嗯，我是说我是。
Well, I mean I was.

651
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:22,276
我的鹅爸爸收养了我，后来，我的熊猫爸爸找到了我。
My goose dad adopted me,and then later, my panda dad found me.

652
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:25,988
鹅爸爸，熊猫爸爸。我想这需要各种各样的人。
Goose dads, panda dads.Guess it takes all kinds.

653
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:27,531
-对,妈妈?——(东欧)
-Right, Mom?-[squawks]

654
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,409
后来有一天，一个当地人收留了我。
Then, one day, a local took me in.

655
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:33,871
给了我栖身之所，给了我穿的衣服，吃的食物。
Put a roof over my head,gave me clothes to wear, food to eat.

656
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:36,248
从那以后，我再也不孤单了。
After that, I was never alone again.

657
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,457
我想我们都很幸运。
I guess we both got lucky.

658
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:38,500
我猜。
I guess.

659
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,878
嘿，跟我说说。回到鹅谷……
Hey, tell me something.Back in the Valley of Geese…

660
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:41,920
和平。
Peace.

661
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:43,422
那个生气的小松鼠是什么意思?
…what did that angry little squirrelmean…

662
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:44,339
红色的熊猫。
Red panda.

663
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:46,383
当他说你必须找到继任者的时候
…when he said you had tofind your successor?

664
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:47,551
(叹息)
[sighs]

665
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,970
现在我要成为精神领袖了，
Now that I'm supposed to becomeSpiritual Leader,

666
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:53,056
我得找个合适的接班人来接替神龙大侠。
I have to find a worthy successorto take over as the Dragon Warrior.

667
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,225
一旦你到了顶峰，你就会想待在那里，对吧?
Once you're on top,that's where you wanna stay, right?

668
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:58,312
不，只是我对精神领袖有什么了解?
No, it's just that-- What do I knowabout being a Spiritual Leader?

669
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:00,856
我甚至连一句听起来很酷的谚语都想不出来。
I can't even come up withone of those cool-sounding proverbs.

670
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,525
“人生最大的敌人是……”
"Life's greatest enemy is"…

671
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:05,736
呃，我不知道。楼梯?
Uh, I don't know. Stairs?

672
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,446
好吧。
Okay.

673
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:09,823
每个人都知道生命最大的敌人是时间。
Everyone knowslife's greatest enemy is time.

674
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:10,782
(东欧)
[squawks]

675
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:13,869
我想，这样更容易坚持你熟悉的生活
I guess it's just easier to hold onto the life you know

676
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,370
那就去找你不喜欢的人。
than move on to the one you don't.

677
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:17,164
嘿，刚才真不错。
Hey, that was pretty good.

678
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:18,081
是的。
Yeah.

679
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:21,919
也许她应该成为鹅谷的精神领袖。
Maybe she should be the Spiritual Leaderof the Valley of Geese.

680
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:23,837
(吞)

681
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:25,881
哇，那个家伙。他酒量很大。
Whoa, that guy.He drinks like a fish.

682
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:27,424
他应该开车吗?
Should he be driving?

683
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:55,577
我们是按你的要求来致敬的。
We've come to pay tribute,as you requested.

684
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:57,454
看起来有点轻。
Looks a little light.

685
00:33:57,538 --> 00:33:59,331
出去再给我拿点来!
Go back out and get me more!

686
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:00,249
更多?
More?

687
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:01,416
可是——可是，变色龙——
But-- But, Chameleon--

688
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,045
走吧!不然我就把你扔下另一段楼梯。
Go! Before I toss youdown another flight of stairs.

689

[犯罪头目窃窃私语]
[crime bosses murmuring]

690
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:11,176
最后，我的命运来临了。
At last, my destiny approaches.

691
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:20,393
我要把我的统治从杜松城扩展到每一个城镇和村庄
I'll expand my rule from Juniper Cityto every city and town and village

692
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:24,022
从这里到和平谷，甚至更远!
from here to the Valley of Peaceand beyond!

693
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:33,322
他们都会知道变色龙的名字!
They will all know the nameof The Chameleon!

[甄]<i>醒醒!醒醒吧!醒醒吧!< / i >
[Zhen] <i>Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!</i>

695
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:38,871
啊!甄!我看到了一个幻象。我看过《变色龙》。
Ah! Zhen! I had a vision.I saw The Chameleon.

696
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:41,915
她会占领城市和城镇，还有和平谷。
She's gonna take over cities and townsand the Valley of Peace.

697
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,625
一个愿景?
A vision?

698
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,168
当你睡着的时候?
While you were asleep?

699
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:46,587
我很确定那只是个梦。
I'm pretty sure that's just a dream.

700
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,380
不是梦，是愿景。
Not a dream, a vision.

701
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:50,465
要么是我睡觉前吃了个坏饺子，
Either I had a bad dumplingbefore I went to sleep,

702
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:52,301
或者是神龙大侠之类的。
or it's a Dragon Warrior thing.

703
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:54,303
我们得去找变色龙，把她拿下。
We got to get to The Chameleonand take her down.

704
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,263
那你就走运了。
Well, then you're in luck.

欢迎来到Juniper City。
Welcome to Juniper City.

我从来没见过这么多车。
I've never seen so much traffic before.

720
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:45,270
[甄]你们平谷没有交通高峰吗?
[Zhen] You don't have rush hourin the Valley of Peace?

00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:47,564
没人会那么着急。现钞。
No one's ever in that much of a rush. Oof.

722

来吧!
Come on!

嗯，再次回家的感觉真好。
Well, sure is good to be home again.

这个城市是我见过的最神奇的地方!
This city is the most amazing placeI've ever seen!

733
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:24,601
我以前也是这么想的，直到变色龙把她的爪子伸进去。
I used to feel the same wayuntil The Chameleon got her claws into it.

哦,是的。

记住，阿宝，除了打屁股，还有其他方式能带来和平。
Remember, Po, there are other waysto bring peace than by kicking butt.

863
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:18,372
啊，别这样。真的吗?现在?
Ah, come on. Really? Now?

864
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:20,249
是的,现在。
Yes, now.

865
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:23,585
等一等。我内心的师父不应该有不同的意见吗?
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner Shifushave differing opinions?

866
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:24,962
我们完全同意……
We are in total agreement…

867
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:26,964
我们都很失望……
…with our mutual disappointment…

868
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:28,131
在你身上。
[both] …in you.

869
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:30,968
等待。
Wait.

870
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,639
现在诉诸暴力的人……
He who resorts to violence now…

871
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:40,185
以后只会发现更多的暴力。
will only find more violence later.

872
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:41,144
(人群)嗯?
[crowd] Huh?

873
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:46,692
所以你的意思是，如果我们现在不伤害珍一点…
So what you're saying is,if we don't hurt Zhen a little now…

874
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:48,652
我们可以以后再伤害她。
We can hurt her a lot later.

875
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,487
怎么啦？不，我不是这么说的。
What? No, that's not what I said.

876
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:54,533
是的!今后暴力增多总比现在暴力减少好。
Yes! And more violence lateris better than less violence now.

877
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:56,910
不,不。我认为你误解了最根本的一点
No, no. I think you're misunderstandingthe fundamental point of--

878
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,328
——暴力! -万岁!
-More violence!-Hooray!

879
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,914
暴力使我肚子发麻。
Violence makes my tummy tingle.

880
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:03,041
你知道吗，那只熊猫说得很有道理。
You know, that pandamakes a lot of good points.

881
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:06,670
-我喜欢。-[兔子]暴力，暴力，还是暴力。
-I like it.-[bunnies] Violence, violence, violence.

882
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:07,880
不，不，不!等等!
No, no, no! Wait!

883
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:08,964
回来!
Come back!

884
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:10,924
我会想出更好的办法。
I'll come up with better wisdom.

885
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:13,886
你必须练习那些谚语。
You have got to workshopthose proverbs.

886
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:17,931
-呃，功夫熊猫?-不是
-[Po] Uh, the Kung Fu Panda?-Nope.

887
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:19,766
[波]平先生和李先生的儿子?
[Po] The son of Mr. Ping and Li?

888
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,685
这两个都是很常见的名字。
Those are both very common names.

889
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:23,478
-由乌龟指导?-抱歉
-Mentored by Oogway?-Sorry.

890
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,147
师傅训练的?
Trained by Master Shifu?

891
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,357
-哦!师傅吗?Yes.-Aha !
-Oh! Master Shifu? Yes.-Aha!

892
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:29,818
每个人都听说过传说中的师父。
Everyone's heard ofthe legendary Master Shifu.

893
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:30,861
但不是你。
But not you.

894
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:34,323
有人说"传奇"吗?把它拿进来。
Did someone say "legendary"?Bring it in.

895
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,701
看,汉族。
Look, Han.

896
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,704
我知道我们有分歧，但我现在真的有麻烦了，
I know we've had our differences,but I'm really in a jam here,

897
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,414
我希望你能帮我
and I was hopingyou could help me out.

898
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:44,249
-谢谢。-别喝那个。
-Thank you.-Don't drink that.

899
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:46,210
(精彩)
[sizzles]

900
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:49,713
哦!(咯咯笑)
Oh! [giggling]

901
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:52,841
我们只需要找个地方躲一段时间，等天气降温。
We just need someplace to lie lowfor a while until the heat cools off.

902
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:54,384
我为什么要帮你?
And why should I help you?

903
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:57,054
因为在铁鳞片般的外表下
Because deep downbeneath that iron-scaled exterior

904
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:58,555
是一个善良的灵魂吗
is a good-hearted soul

905
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:00,474
谁还认为我是家里的一员?
who still thinks of meas one of the family?

906
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:02,643
很好。
Fine.

907
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:06,188
但如果天黑前你还在这里，我就要亲自报警了。
But if you're still here by nightfall,I'm calling the bulls myself.

908
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:07,856
睡个好觉。
Sleep tight.

909
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,025
(汉呵呵)
[Han chuckling]

910
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:14,196
所以今晚，我们要拿下变色龙。
So tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

911
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:15,781
在你拿回裤子之后。
After you get your pants back.

912
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,367
不酷!你们——
Not cool! You guys--

913
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,993
来吧!把它们还给我。
Come on! Give them back.

914
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:21,411
这些都是习俗。
Those are custom.

915
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:23,539
(猿尖叫)
[apes shrieking]

916
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:31,129
是啊，这地方看起来不太友好。
Yeah, this place doesn'tlook very friendly.

917
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:34,341
哦!哦，我的尾巴。(普通员工)
Oh! Oh, my tail. [grunts]

918
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:37,511
我相信一切都很好。
I'm sure everything is fine.

919
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:38,971
这是一家餐馆。
This is a restaurant.

920
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:41,974
他们是我的人。我们说同一种语言。
These are my people.We speak the same language.

921
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:43,225
你在这儿等着。
You wait here.

922
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:47,104
你好!
Salutations!

923
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,690
很抱歉打扰你。[笑]
I'm so sorry to interrupt. [chuckles]

924
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:51,149
我知道你玩得很开心，
I know you're having a good time,

925
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:55,821
但我想知道一只熊猫会不会碰巧经过这些地方?
but I was wondering if a pandahappened to be passing by these parts?

926
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:57,865
这里有一只熊猫。
There was a panda here.

927
00:44:58,532 --> 00:44:59,616
你认识他?
You know him?

928
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,411
认识他吗?为什么，我是他爸爸!
Know him? Why, I'm his dad!

929
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:04,413
(嘎嘎叫)
[quacking]

930
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,707
不，不，不，不。嗯?
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hmm?

931
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:10,919
你得为你儿子对我酒馆的所作所为付出代价。
You need to payfor what your son did to my tavern.

932
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:14,214
(玻璃打破了)
[glass shatters]

933
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:18,218
我儿子不会无缘无故这么做的。
My boy wouldn't have done thisfor no reason.

934
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:20,179
有没有可能你的汤太淡了?
Is it possible your broth was bland?

935
00:45:20,262 --> 00:45:21,555
试一试。
Try it.

936
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:24,308
(惊呼)不，不!
[exclaims] No, no!

937
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,310
这汤闻起来好香。
The broth smells excellent.

938
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:30,063
你不应该添加任何东西，尤其是我!
You should not add a single thing,especially not me!

939
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:31,607
[李]别碰鹅。
[Li] Hands off the goose.

940
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,693
[酒馆主顾们喘着粗气]
[tavern patrons gasping]

941
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:36,612
熊猫回来了。
The panda's back.

942
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:38,071
他回来了吗?他回来了吗?
-He's back?-He's back?

943
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:39,156
不。
No.

944
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:42,910
但你会希望他是，
But you're about to wish he was,

945
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:45,370
因为如果你认为是他把这里搞得一团糟
'cause if you think he made a messof this place,

946
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:48,332
你根本不知道我能干出什么来。
you have no idea what I'm capable of.

947
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,293
他学到的一切都是跟我学的。
Everything he learned, he learned from me.

948
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:55,506
除了一件事。
Except one thing.

949
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:57,049
仁慈。
Mercy.

950
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:01,762
我不知道他是怎么知道的，因为我不相信。
I don't know where he got that,because I don't believe in it.

951
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:06,600
这有两种可能。
Now, this can go one of two ways.

952
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:10,979
最简单的方法，你告诉我他在哪里，
The easy way,in which you tell me where he is,

953
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:12,064
或者艰难的方式，
or the hard way,

954
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:14,816
告诉我他在哪里，
in which you tell me where he is,

955
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,777
但我很难理解你在说什么
but it's hard to understandwhat you're saying

956
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,153
因为你没有牙齿。
because you have no teeth.

957
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:23,659
[酒馆主顾们倒抽一口冷气]
[tavern patrons gasp]

958
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:25,410
(喘着气,低声呻吟)
[gasps, whimpers]

959
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:26,828
麻将。
Mah-jongg.

960
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:29,915
我早餐吃麻将牌!
I eat mah-jongg tiles for breakfast!

961
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:36,630
(叹息)
[groans]

00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:38,423
[酒馆主顾咆哮]
[tavern patrons growling]

963

(咕哝,惊呼道)
[grunts, exclaims]

964

[酒馆主顾叫嚷]
[tavern patrons shouting]

00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:57,442
(喘气)
[gasping]

968
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:58,652
嗯?
Huh?

969
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:01,029
(木头吱吱作响)
[wood creaking]

970
00:47:03,073 --> 00:47:05,993
-[咯咯的笑声]-[酒馆里吵吵嚷嚷的顾客]
-[chuckles]-[tavern patrons clamoring]

971
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:09,496
(争相继续)
[clamoring continues]

972
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:11,748
呆在那儿!
Stay there!

973
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:12,791
我们的儿子呢?
Where's our son?

974
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,668
他乘船去了杜松城。
He took a boat to Juniper City.

975
00:47:14,751 --> 00:47:15,836
哪条路?
Which way?

976
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:19,089
你知道，聪明的鹅曾经
You know, a wise goose once--

977
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:20,382
该走了。
Time to go.

978
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:21,717
嗯,是的。正确的。
Uh, yeah. Right.

979
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,926
(叹息)
[sighs]

980
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:24,928
[酒馆顾客尖叫]
[tavern patrons screaming]

981
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:30,350
[酒馆里的顾客咳嗽、呻吟]
[tavern patrons coughing, groaning]

982
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:34,438
(叹息)
[groans]

983
00:47:35,063 --> 00:47:36,064
(欢呼)
[cheering]

984
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:42,237
(公民聊天)
[citizens chattering]

985
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,913
(咯咯笑)
[giggling]

986
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:54,082
好吧，我们再试一次。
Okay, let's try this again.

987
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:58,837
搅动锅，滚锅，上菜，然后砰!
Stir the pot, roll the wok,serve the dish, and ska-blam!

988
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:02,674
嘿，那只本该射出去的金龙呢?
Hey, where's the golden dragonthat's supposed to shoot out?

989
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:04,510
用扫帚可不行。
Not gonna happen with a broom.

990
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:05,677
是吗?不过还不错。
Yeah? Still not bad though.

991
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:11,016
是的。但稍后搅拌，卷得更高，单词是“skadoosh”。
Yeah. But stir later, roll higher,and the word is "skadoosh."

992
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:12,476
“Skadoosh”不是一个词。
"Skadoosh" isn't a word.

993
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,645
- "ska- blame "是什么?——(烟火)
-And "ska-blam" is?-[fireworks explode]

994
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,525
(猿唧唧的声音)
[ape yelps]

995
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:20,609
[所有]Ska-blam !
[all] Ska-blam!

996
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:25,572
(叹息)
[sighs]

997
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:29,743
我得说，你跟我见过的其他大师都不一样。
I gotta say, you're notlike any of the other masters I've met.

998
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:31,870
是的，我知道。没有很多熊猫。
Yeah, I know.There's not a lot of pandas.

999
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:34,790
不，你是个好人。
No, you're, like, a good guy.

1000
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:37,209
听好了。没有危险了。
Listen up. The coast is clear.

1001
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,670
小偷们，到街上去。
Thieves, hit the streets.

1002
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:41,004
你们俩呢，
And you two,

1003
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,673
滚出我的视线。
get out of my sight.

1004
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:55,477
嗯?
Huh?

1005
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,280
我知道我答应过带你到变色龙的前门
I know I promised that I'd lead youright to The Chameleon's front door,

1006
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:09,032
但“后门”似乎更实用一些。
but the back door seemsa little more practical.

1007
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:13,370
我得说，甄，你真是个守信用的人。
I gotta say, Zhen,you really are a fox of your word.

1008
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:15,497
嚼过的桃核?
A chewed-up peach pit?

1009
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:18,458
一只来自乌龟大师天上智慧的桃树。
One from Master Oogway's peach treeof heavenly wisdom.

1010
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:21,837
这是和平谷的事。
Eh, it's a Valley of Peace thing.

1011
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,091
它应该提醒我，每个角落都有参天大树的希望。
It's supposed to remind me that every pitholds the promise of a mighty tree.

1012
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:30,095
也许对你也有同样的效果。
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

1013
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:37,686
你确定要这么做吗?
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1014
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:40,564
正如一位睿智的精神领袖曾经说过的，
As a wise Spiritual Leader once said,

1015
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:45,611
如果一个人不去找别人踢，他怎么能踢别人的屁股呢?
how may one kick butt,if one doesn't seek a butt to kick?

1016
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:49,865
你知道吗，你真的很厉害?
You're a real piece of work,you know that?

1017
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:51,116
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1018
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,744
等等，这是恭维还是侮辱?
Wait, was that a compliment or an insult?

1019
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:54,870
(深圳)是的。
[Zhen] Yes.

(尖叫)
[yelping]

1023
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:09,051

1030
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:25,359
等等，他们为什么要走?你答应了。
Wait, why are they leaving? You said yes.

1031
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:28,987
嘿,你看。阿宝在这里。
Hey, look. Po was here.

1032
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:31,448
太棒了，李，但你怎么知道?
Amazing, Li, but how can you tell?

1033
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:34,493
哦，我们熊猫有一种天赋，能看到别人看不到的东西。
Oh, we pandas have a giftfor seeing what others cannot.

1034
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:36,912

甄?
Zhen?

1062
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,162
你要把我的员工带到哪里去?
Where are you taking my staff?

1063
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:46,875
我想你是说我的员工吧?
I think you mean my staff?

1064
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:50,712
你把它给了甄，现在甄又给了我。
You gave it to Zhen,and now Zhen has given it to me.

1065
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:53,924
我相信"付出是为了获得"是这样的吧?
"Given to gain,"I believe, is how it works?

1066
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,551
你说得对，甄。
You were right, Zhen.

1067
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:56,969
他是个容易上当的人。
He was an easy mark.

街头守则第一条:永远不要相信任何人。

1070
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:03,517
(笑)我教她的。
[chuckles] I taught her that.

1071
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,228
你以为我的学徒是你的朋友?
And you thought my apprenticewas your friend?

1072
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,479
学徒吗?
Apprentice?

1073
00:53:07,563 --> 00:53:09,398
是她收留了你吗?
She's the one that took you in?

1074
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:11,817
这对她来说是最好的事。
Best thing that ever happened to her.

1075
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,195
在我找到她之前，你真该看看那个小流浪汉。
You should have seenthe little guttersnipe before I found her.

1082
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:56,028
所以我收留了她。
So I took her in.

1083
00:53:57,613 --> 00:53:59,907
我造就了今天的她。
I made her what she is today.

1084
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,491
站直。
Stand up straight.

1085
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:02,659
是的,主人。
Yes, master.

1086
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:06,330
所以你经历这一切就是为了让我把智慧之杖给你?
So you went through all of this just toget me to give you the Staff of Wisdom?

1087
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:07,414
为什么?
Why?

1088
00:54:07,497 --> 00:54:13,295
我也出身贫寒，梦想着出人头地。
I, too, came from humble beginningsand dreamed of becoming something more.

1089
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:15,339
我想要尊重和权力。
I wanted respect and power.

1090
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:18,091
我想成为一名功夫大师。
I wanted to be a master of kung fu.

1091
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:19,176
你说什么?
Say what?

1092
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:22,763
我每次去训练馆都被拒之门外。
I was turned awayfrom every training hall I went to.

1093
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:26,850
他们会说我太小，太卑微，
They would say I was too small, too lowly,

1094
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:30,062
功夫不是我的命运。
and that kung fu was not my destiny.

1095
00:54:30,145 --> 00:54:33,315
所以，我选择了一条不同的道路。
And so, I chose a different path.

1096
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:35,067
巫术。
Sorcery.

1097
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,318
我做了。
I grew.

1098
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:38,612
我擅长。
I excelled.

1099
00:54:38,695 --> 00:54:42,449
我得到了我梦寐以求的一切。
And I got everythingI had ever dreamed of.

1100
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:45,410
-除了功夫。-[咆哮]
-Everything except kung fu.-[roars]

1101
00:54:45,494 --> 00:54:49,623
我长得像大龙并不意味着我能像他那样打架。
Just because I can look like Tai Lungdoesn't mean I can fight like him.

1102
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:54,878
阿宝，你看，功夫可能是靠身体来表演的，
You see, Po, kung fu may beperformed by the body,

1103
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:57,965
但它的秘密藏在灵魂里。
but its secrets are housed in the spirit.

1104
00:54:58,048 --> 00:55:00,592
现在我已经进入了灵界
And now that I have accessto the Spirit Realm--

1105
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:02,803
你要偷大龙的功夫。
You're gonna steal Tai Lung's kung fu.

1106
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:06,390
他和所有在我之前的大坏蛋。
His and those of every master villainthat came before me.

1107
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:11,311
一旦我做到了，就没人敢再低估我了。
And once I do, no one will dareunderestimate me again.

1108
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:13,355
你忘了我。
You forgot about me.

[chuckles] Don't bother, Po.

1111
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:23,323
那些栏杆被施了魔法，非常古老，非常强大。
Those bars are enchanted withsome very old and very powerful magic.

1112
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:27,286
你至少需要十个神龙武士才能穿过它们。
You'd need at least ten Dragon Warriorsto get through them.

1113
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:28,829
那我就不一一讲了。
Then I won't go through them.

1114
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:30,956

Well done, Zhen.

1139
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:54,414
你从没说过要伤害他。
You never said you were gonna hurt him.

不，你跟着我是因为你不相信我。
No, you followedbecause you didn't believe in me.

00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:33,514
我搞砸了。
I screwed up big-time.

1178
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:36,225
我信任错了人。
I trusted the wrong person.

1179
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:38,810
我把智慧之杖给了变色龙。
I gave the Staff of Wisdomright to The Chameleon.

1180
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:41,480
哦……
Oh…

1181
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:46,818
阿宝，这真是个大麻烦。
Po, that was a very big-time screw-up.

1182
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:49,154
(叹息)
[sighs]

1183
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:53,200
要是我听师父的话，留在和平谷就好了，
If only I'd listened to Master Shifuand stayed in the Valley of Peace,

1184
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:56,787
变色龙没有我的权杖，这一切都不会发生。
The Chameleon wouldn't have my staff,and none of this would be happening.

1185
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,748
我只是下定决心要让一切保持原样。
I was just so determinedto keep things the way they were.

1186
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:02,918
每个人都害怕改变，阿宝。
Everyone is afraid of change, Po.

1187
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:04,545
即使是我。
Even me.

1188
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:07,422
不久前有一段时间
There was a time not so long ago

1189
00:59:07,506 --> 00:59:12,344
当时我只想成为山谷里最伟大的面馆厨师
when all I wanted to be wasthe greatest noodle chef in the valley.

1190
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:13,804
那么发生了什么?
So what happened?

1191
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:16,890
我成了山谷里最伟大的面馆厨师。
I became the greatest noodle chefin the valley.

1192
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,016
这是真的。
It's true.

1193
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,060
但我也成为了一名父亲。
But I also became a father.

1194
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:23,897
从那以后，一切都变了。
And nothing…nothing's ever been the same since.

1195
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:27,359
改变并不总是坏事。
Change doesn't alwayshave to be a bad thing.

1196
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:30,946
你以为我为什么总是在餐厅更改菜单?
Why do you think I always changethe menu at the restaurant?

1197
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:35,117
因为如果事情永远保持不变，
Because if things stayed the same forever,

1198
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,995
它们迟早会失去味道的。
sooner or later,they would lose their flavor.

1199
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:40,747
他说得对，阿宝。
He's right, Po.

1200
00:59:40,831 --> 00:59:44,042
自从我离开我的村庄，我变成了一个战士。
Since I left my village,I've become a bit of a warrior.

1201
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:45,961
强。勇敢。——(鞭裂缝)
-Strong. Brave.-[whip cracks]

1202
00:59:46,044 --> 00:59:47,379
——(呼喊,普通员工)——(呻吟)
-[shouts, grunts]-[groans]

1203
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:49,214
-[科莫多龙]移动它。——(鞭睫毛)
-[Komodo dragon] Move it.-[whip lashes]

1204
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:50,299
这种方式。
This way.

1205
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:53,635
把那些笼子搬上去。来吧。
Get those cages up there. Come on.

1206
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:56,555
嗯。这看起来很糟糕。
Hmm. This looks bad.

1207
00:59:56,638 --> 00:59:57,681
非常糟糕。
Really bad.

1208
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:58,765
[科莫多龙]快走。
[Komodo dragon] Move it.

1209
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:00,684
-[鞭裂]-[科莫多龙]来吧。
-[whip cracks]-[Komodo dragon] Come on.

1210
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:10,152
别告诉我你真的开始和那只熊猫成为朋友了。
Don't tell me you were actually startingto become friends with that panda.

1211
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:12,779
怎么啦？不。这就是——没办法
What? No. It's-It's just--

1212
01:00:12,863 --> 01:00:16,533
当我们想要某样东西的时候，我们必须用我们所拥有的一切去得到它。
When we want something, we must usewhatever is at our disposal to get it.

1213
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:19,786
那只熊猫就是个有用的东西。
That's all that panda was,something to use.

1214
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:26,168
这就是你收留我的原因吗?好让我帮你得到你想要的吗?
Is that why you took me in?So I could help you get what you wanted?

1215
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:27,586
[笑]甄。
[chuckles] Zhen.

1216
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:32,049
我收留你是因为你聪明，无情，不多愁善感，
I took you in because you were cleverand ruthless and unsentimental,

1217
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:33,133
喜欢我。
like me.

1218
01:00:33,217 --> 01:00:35,511
等到你不再是那些人的那一天
And the day you stop being those things

1219
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:39,890
就是你对我不再有用的那一天。
is the day when, yes,you stop being useful to me.

1220
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:43,477
所以为了我们俩，不要改变。
So for both of our sakes,don't change.

1221
01:00:44,228 --> 01:00:46,021
(天窗解锁)
[skylight unlocks]

1222
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:55,614
今晚，当血月升到夜空的最高点时，
Tonight, when the blood moon risesto its highest point in the night sky,

1223
01:00:55,697 --> 01:01:01,537
我将打开通往灵界的大门，它所有的秘密都将属于我!
I will open the door to the Spirit Realm,and all of its secrets will be mine!

1224
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,955
(呼吸严重)
[breathes heavily]

1225
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:10,045
血月总是升得这么慢吗?
Does the blood moonalways rise this slowly?

1226
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:12,130
(两个聊天)
[both chitter]

1227
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:14,550
我记得它升得更快。
I seem to remember it rising faster.

1228
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,553
没有?
No?

1229
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:18,637
只是我吗?
Just me?

1230
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:20,806
嗯。
Hmm.

1231
01:01:22,933 --> 01:01:24,101
啊。
Ugh.

1232
01:01:24,184 --> 01:01:26,270
这只是为了戏剧效果。
It's just for dramatic effect anyway.

1233
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:29,231
(嘲笑)我想我现在要打开灵界了。
[scoffs] I think I'm just gonnaopen the Spirit Realm now.

1234
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:42,870
把大龙给我带来!
Bring me Tai Lung!

1235
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:49,751
(咆哮)
[growling]

1236
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:54,131
[变色龙]大龙。
[The Chameleon] Tai Lung.

1237
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:56,216
大风扇。
Big fan.

1238
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,094
你是谁，你拿那根棍子干什么?
Who are you,and what are you doing with that staff?

1239
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:02,222
这是你的一个老朋友给我的。
This was given to meby an old friend of yours.

1240
01:02:02,306 --> 01:02:03,724
胖胖的熊猫?
The puffy panda?

1241
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:05,184
[笑]阿宝也许是个白痴，
[chuckles] Po might be an idiot,

1242
01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:09,146
但他绝不会愿意把乌龟的权杖交给你这种人。
but he'd never willingly hand overOogway's staff to the likes of you.

1243
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:11,523
谁说愿意了?
Who said anything about willingly?

1244
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:13,025
(声)
[rumbling]

1245
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:24,786
嗯。显然我看错你了，蜥蜴。
Hmm. Apparently I misjudged you, lizard.

1246
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:27,289
你为什么把我带回来?
Now, why have you brought me back?

1247
01:02:27,372 --> 01:02:29,458
我把你召来是为了让你教我
I summoned you hereso that you could teach me

1248
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,543
你最传奇的功夫动作。
your most legendary kung fu moves.

1249
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:34,671
我不跟任何人分享我的技能。
I don't share my skills with anyone.

1250
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:36,381
这不是请求。
It wasn't a request.

大龙神经休克。
The Tai Lung nerve strike.

1261

力量，精准。
The power, the precision.

你对我做了什么?
What have you done to me?

1265
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:43,156
你的功夫现在都是我的了。
All of your kung fu is now mine.

1266
01:03:44,074 --> 01:03:48,537
最棒的是，我才刚开始热身。
And the best part is,I'm just getting warmed up.

1267
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,914
把凯将军带来。
Bring me General Kai.

1268

把鱼鹰大师带来。
Bring me Master Osprey.

1272
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:11,560
请讲道理。
Please be reasonable.

01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:13,770
在拿回我的员工之前，我哪也不去。
I'm not going anywhereuntil I get my staff back.

1274

只要我还是神龙大侠，

我不会让任何人因为我而受伤。

Please. I made a mistake.

我也是，相信你。
So did I. Trusting you.

1282
01:04:49,473 --> 01:04:50,432
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1283
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:52,851
这也是你主人叫你说的吗?
Did your master tell youto say that too?

1284
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:56,063
她不是我的主人。我要离开，永远离开。
She's not my master.I'm leaving, for good.

1285
01:04:56,897 --> 01:04:58,190
这是事实。
It's the truth.

1286
01:04:58,273 --> 01:05:00,275
我错了。

不。
No.

移动。
Move.

1292
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:12,204
你想让我搬家吗?
You want me to move?

1293
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:13,497
我移动。
Move me.

1294
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,083
你先是背叛我，现在又想和我打架?
First you betray me,and now you wanna fight me?

1295
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:18,669
你为什么要这么做?
-[Zhen grunts]-Why are you doing this?

1296
01:05:18,752 --> 01:05:21,672
(深呼吸)为了不让你被杀。

你管我死不死呢?
What do you careif I get killed or not?

1306
01:06:07,718 --> 01:06:09,344
请订单。
Please, Po.

1307
01:06:09,428 --> 01:06:11,555
让我做对一件事。
Just let me do one thing right.

1308
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:19,563
你不是最近唯一做了错误选择的人。
You're not the only onewho's made some bad choices lately.

1309
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:23,692
你真的要结束这一切了，是吗?
You're really gonnago through with this, aren't you?

1310
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:24,818
“胆小鬼。
'Fraid so.

1311
01:06:24,902 --> 01:06:27,738
我怎么也不能劝你放弃吗?
And there's nothing I can doto talk you out of it?

1312
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:28,906
恐怕不行。
I'm afraid not.

1313
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:30,908
你知道，你打不过她的。
You can't beat her, you know.

1314
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:32,492
你可能是对的。
You're probably right.

1315
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:35,370
但我必须试试。
But I have to try.

1316
01:06:36,997 --> 01:06:38,957
离这个地方越远越好。
Get as far away from this placeas you can.

1317
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:40,042
阿宝!
Po!

1318
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,252
[平先生]我们就不该让他到这里来。
[Mr. Ping] We should never havelet him come here.

1319
01:06:42,336 --> 01:06:44,505
我们是如此糟糕的父亲。
We are such terrible fathers.

1320
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:46,423
至少你没有撒谎，没有背叛他。
At least you didn't lie and betray him.

1321
01:06:46,507 --> 01:06:48,842
嗯，那是真的。你变得更糟。
Well, that's true.You're worse.

1322
01:06:48,926 --> 01:06:50,761
我是一个糟糕的朋友。
I am a terrible friend.

1323
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:53,472
“朋友”?感觉有点慷慨，不是吗?
"Friend"?That feels a little generous, no?

1324
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:55,682
我们就放弃吧，投降。
Uh, l-let's just give up.Surrender.

1325
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:57,351
我们不能让他一个人进去。
We can't let him go in there alone.

1326
01:06:57,434 --> 01:06:58,936
我们能做什么?
What can we do?

1327
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:01,396
我们只有三个人对抗一支军队。
There are just three of usagainst an army.

1328
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,191
那我想我们只能自己找一支军队了。
Then I guess we'll just have toget an army of our own.

1336
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:29,132
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1337
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:31,218
神龙大侠有麻烦了。
The Dragon Warrior's in trouble.

1338
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:34,221
——谁?-你知道的，阿宝。
-Who?-You know, Po.

1339
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:36,849
熊猫。
The panda.

1340
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:41,979
不,不。一只不同的熊猫。
No, no. A different panda.

1341
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:44,189
-我是他的父亲。-我也是他的父亲。
-I'm his father.-I'm also his father.

1342
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,108
好吧，没关系。
Okay, that doesn't matter.

1343
01:07:46,191 --> 01:07:49,778
重要的是我的朋友遇到了麻烦，他需要我的帮助。
What matters is that my friend'sin trouble and he needs my help.

1344
01:07:49,862 --> 01:07:51,738
所以，我需要你的。
So, I need yours.

1345
01:07:51,822 --> 01:07:53,574
我们为什么要帮你?
Why should we help you?

1346
01:07:53,657 --> 01:07:54,908
因为——
Because--

1347
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:55,993
因为…
Because…

1348
01:07:56,869 --> 01:07:58,412
这是正确的做法。
it's the right thing to do.

1349
01:08:01,123 --> 01:08:02,749
[笑]
[laughing]

1350
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,710
阻止它。停止。
Stop it. Stop.

1351
01:08:04,793 --> 01:08:06,044
停止笑。
Stop laughing.

1352
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:09,673
听着，我知道你觉得可能太晚了
Look, I know you thinkit might be too late

1353
01:08:09,756 --> 01:08:14,428
对于一群像我们这样的骗子，小偷和杀手来说，改变我们的方式，
for a bunch of cheats, thieves andcutthroats like us to change our ways,

1354
01:08:14,511 --> 01:08:19,515
但是一个好朋友曾经告诉我，做正确的事永远不会太晚。
but a good friend once told meit's never too late to do the right thing.

1355
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,060
所以你的意思是，我们现在做得越对，
So what you're saying is,the more right we do now,

1356
01:08:23,145 --> 01:08:25,104
我们以后犯的错误就越多。
the more wrong we can do later.

1357
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:26,314
-什么?不。——(人群杂音)
-What? No.-[crowd murmurs]

1358
01:08:26,398 --> 01:08:28,859
有了变色龙…
And with The Chameleon out of the way…

1359
01:08:28,942 --> 01:08:31,069
我们终于可以为所欲为了。
We can finally do all the wrong we want.

1360
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:33,113
我觉得你忽略了最根本的一点。
I-I think you're missingthe fundamental point.

1361

1362
01:08:35,823 --> 01:08:39,578
你们准备好为错误的理由做正确的事了吗?
Are you guys ready to do the right thingfor the wrong reasons?

01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:40,703
(欢呼)

1364
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:47,169
现在，你看，这个神龙大侠犯了个错误
Now, you see, this mistakethis Dragon Warrior fellow made

1365
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:48,962
低估了他的对手。
was underestimating his opponent.

1366
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:51,924
我绝对不会掉进这么明显的陷阱。
I never would have walkedinto such an obvious trap.

——(Po)嘿。——(喘息声,咕哝声)
-[Po] Hey.-[gasps, grunts]

1368
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:58,680
现在，你看，这位神龙大侠犯的错误是——
Now, you see, the mistakethis Dragon Warrior fellow made was that--

1369
01:08:58,764 --> 01:09:00,349
(惹恼科莫多)闭嘴，拉里。
[annoyed Komodo] Shut up, Larry.

1370
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,397
这地方的警卫比我见过的都多。
This place is crawlingwith more guards than I've ever seen.

1371
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:09,483
我不可能及时找到阿宝。
I'm never gonna get to Po in time.

1372
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:12,277
你去找阿宝。我们会搞定守卫的。
You just get to Po.We'll take care of the guards.

1373
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:13,654
我们会吗?[笑]
We will? [chuckles]

1374
01:09:13,737 --> 01:09:15,154
我是说，我们会的。
I-I mean, we will.

1375
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:16,365
但如何?
But how?

1376
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:18,533
交给我吧。
Just leave that to me.

让我们失去了所有的动作。
and draining us of all our moves.

1389
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:05,122
她是在利用你的员工。
And she's using your staff to do it.

1390

-我是来拿回来的。——(鳄鱼嘲笑)
-I'm here to get it back.-[crocodile scoffs]

01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:10,169
抱歉，我认识你吗?
Um, I'm sorry, do I know you?

你认识我吗?这是斯科特。

[coughing] Oh, right! Scott! [coughs]

1396

师父和我正在说你呢。
Master Shifu and Iwere just talking about you.

[大龙]熊猫。
[Tai Lung] Panda.

1398
01:10:23,182 --> 01:10:26,935
乌龟选你当神龙大侠是个错误。
Oogway made a mistakechoosing you as the Dragon Warrior.

1399
01:10:28,061 --> 01:10:32,191
我只是直到现在才意识到这是个多大的错误。
I just didn't realizehow big a mistake it was until now.

1400
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:34,735
哇。大肺吗?
Whoa. Tai Lung?

1401
01:10:34,818 --> 01:10:38,280
我要拿回权杖，恢复你的功夫，
I'm gonna get that staff back,restore your kung fu,

1402
01:10:38,363 --> 01:10:40,741
把你们都送回灵界。
and return you allback to the Spirit Realm.

你会看到。
You'll see.

我所看到的
All I see

1405
01:10:44,244 --> 01:10:46,163
是一个破碎的承诺。

好了，你们这群脾气暴躁的科莫多。
All right, you bunch ofcantankerous Komodos.

1407
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:59,092
这有两种可能。
Now, this can go one of two ways.

1408
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:02,888
最简单的方法，就是你心甘情愿地投降，
The easy way,in which you surrender willingly,

1409
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:07,017
或者走艰难的路，受伤投降。
or the hard way,where you surrender woundedly.

1410
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,811
选择权在你。
The choice is yours.

我相信你有我的东西。
I believe you have somethingthat belongs to me.

1433
01:12:25,429 --> 01:12:27,598
你就不能去死吗?
Can't you even die right?

1434
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:29,558
你甚至不能杀错人吗?
Can't you even kill wrong?

1435
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:31,894
不。(笑)文字游戏没有出现在一起。
No. [chuckles]Wordplay didn't come together.

1436
01:12:31,977 --> 01:12:33,228
现在，关于那根手杖……
Now, about that staff…

1437
01:12:35,606 --> 01:12:36,607
[变色龙]拿去吧。
[The Chameleon] Take it.

1438
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:39,276
反正我需要的东西都有了。
I already have everything I needfrom it anyway.

在很多方面都很相似。
alike in so many ways.

01:12:49,494 --> 01:12:51,038
要是每次都有饺子就好了
If only I had a dumpling for every time

1443
01:12:51,121 --> 01:12:52,956
一个恶棍告诉我我们有很多共同点。
a villain told mehow much we had in common.

1444
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,041
这是真的。
It's true.

1445
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:56,376
我们都登上了世界之巅。
We've both risento the highest of heights.

1446
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:59,505
真遗憾，我们中只有一个人能脱颖而出。
It's a shame only one of us cancome out on top.

1447
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:02,132
这是你的耻辱。
It is a shame, for you.

1448
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:07,095
我的魔法和功力使我势不可挡。
My combined powers of sorcery and kung fumake me unstoppable.

1449
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:11,558
一旦我解雇了你，我就会把我的地盘从杜松子城扩大到
And once I dispense with you,I'll expand my rule from Juniper City to--

1450
01:13:11,642 --> 01:13:13,352
所有其他城市，城镇和村庄
Every other city and town and village

1451
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:15,103
从这里到和平谷，甚至更远。
from here to the Valley of Peaceand beyond.

1452
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,313
是的，我知道。
Yeah, I know.

1453
01:13:16,396 --> 01:13:18,398
但你是怎么知道的?
But how did you know?

1454
01:13:18,482 --> 01:13:22,361
我在梦里看到的，因为我是神龙大侠……
I saw it in a visionbecause I'm the Dragon Warrior…

1455
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:25,864
至少现在是这样。
for now at least.

1456
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:29,451
但我意识到，也许是时候做出改变了。
But I've realizedthat it's probably time I made a change.

1457
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:31,954
你也应该这样。
And so should you.

1458
01:13:32,037 --> 01:13:34,831
我是变色龙。我除了改变什么都不做。
I'm The Chameleon.I do nothing but change.

1459
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:36,667
只是在外面。
Only on the outside.

1460
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:39,419
真正的改变是从内部发生的。
Real change happens from within.

1461
01:13:39,503 --> 01:13:41,880
如果我们真的像你说的一样，
And if we're really as alike as you say,

1462
01:13:41,964 --> 01:13:43,924
也许我们都能放下自己
then maybe we could both let goof who we were

1463
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:46,343
变得比现在更好。
and become something betterthan we already are.

1464
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:49,638
-你说呢?我说…
-What do you say?-I say…

(东欧)
[squawks]

1466
01:13:52,224 --> 01:13:53,725
嗯，我早就料到了。

你永远不知道你能做什么，直到你去做。

你是来听乌龟的人生建议的吗?

是坑，真。

我为你做了那么多，你却为了熊猫背叛了我?
After all I've done for you,you betrayed me for the panda?

这是一个很酷的举动。
Now, that's a cool move.

1573
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:58,382
阿宝!只要你想，你随时都可以逃出牢笼?
Po! You could have gotten out of that cageanytime you wanted?

1574
01:19:58,465 --> 01:19:59,550
你骗子。
You faker.

1575
01:19:59,633 --> 01:20:01,635
这不是假装。它的方法。
It's not faking. It's Method.

1576
01:20:01,718 --> 01:20:04,847
再说，桃子怎么可能长成树呢
Besides, how's a peach pitever supposed to become a tree

1577
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,641
如果你不给它成长的机会?
if you never give itthe chance to grow?

1578
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:12,729
而且，嘿，你搅得更快，滚得更高。
And, hey, you stirred fasterand rolled higher.

也许乌龟对你的看法是对的。
Maybe Oogway was right about you.

1585
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:57,566
你也不是一无是处。
You aren't completely useless after all.

1586
01:20:58,442 --> 01:20:59,985
哦，我的天啊。非常感谢。
Oh, my gosh.Thank you so much.

1597

谢谢,伙计们。
Thanks, guys.

1598
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:43,505
我在想，等我服完刑，重获自由之后，
I was thinking, after I serve my timeand I'm a free fox again,

1599
01:22:43,589 --> 01:22:46,341
也许我会开一家风靡一时的针灸店。
maybe I'll open one of thoseacupuncture places that are all the rage.

1600
01:22:46,425 --> 01:22:51,180
我认为你更适合一份有更大发展空间的工作。
I think you're better suited for a jobwith a little more room for growth.

1601
01:22:55,017 --> 01:22:56,018
玉宫吗?
Jade Palace?

1602
01:22:57,853 --> 01:22:59,605
(吐)她吗?
[spits] Her?

1603
01:22:59,688 --> 01:23:03,483
在您挑选的所有接班人中，
Out of all the candidates you chooseto train as your worthy successor,

1604
01:23:03,567 --> 01:23:05,194
你选择了狐狸?
you chose the fox?

1605
01:23:05,277 --> 01:23:07,279
你知道当你知道的时候，你知道吗?
You know when you know,you know?

1606
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:09,907
好吧，选择你想要的。小偷，大棒，胡萝卜。
Fine, choose who you want.A thief, a stick, a carrot.

1607
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:11,700
我都不知道我为什么要麻烦你。
I don't even know why I bother.

1608
01:23:11,783 --> 01:23:14,536
我要去冥想，经常冥想。
I'm going to go meditate… a lot.

1609
01:23:16,997 --> 01:23:18,874
别担心。他会回心转意的。
Don't worry. He'll come around.

[sighs]

1613
01:23:26,965 --> 01:23:29,593
他是对的。我怎么就说我准备好了?
He's right.What about me says I'm ready for this?

1614
01:23:30,802 --> 01:23:33,096
就像我在我爸的厨房里工作学到的，
Well, as I learnedfrom working in my dad's kitchen,

1615
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:37,684
有时候，最伟大的菜肴来自最不可能的食材。
sometimes the greatest dishes comefrom the most unlikely ingredients.

1616
01:23:37,768 --> 01:23:39,770
